## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in labpubs, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

**Email**: nmweber@uw.edu

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact

You should receive a response within 72 hours. We will work with you to understand and address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

labpubs handles API keys (Semantic Scholar, Slack webhooks) and stores publication data in a local SQLite database. Security concerns related to credential handling, data integrity, or dependency vulnerabilities are in scope.
